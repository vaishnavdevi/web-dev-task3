# web-dev-task3

Task Description:
The objective of this project was to develop a functional TO-DO application with the
following features:
1. Adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
2. Marking tasks as completed.
3. Persistent task storage using local storage.
4. Implementing a dark mode and light mode toggle.

Steps Taken:
1. HTML Structure: Created the basic HTML structure for the TO-DO application
including the input field, add button, and task list.
2. CSS Styling: Developed the CSS for styling the application, including light and dark
mode themes.
3. JavaScript Functionality:
• Implemented task addition, deletion, editing, and completion toggling.
• Used local storage to persist tasks across page reloads.
• Implemented the dark mode toggle functionality, saving the user's preference in
local storage.
• Final Integration: Integrated all components (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to ensure
seamless interaction and functionality.

Learnings:
1. Local Storage: Gained in-depth understanding of how to use local storage to persist
data in web applications.
2. Event Handling in JavaScript: Enhanced skills in handling various user events such as
clicks and key presses to trigger specific actions.
3. Dynamic DOM Manipulation: Improved proficiency in dynamically updating the
DOM to reflect changes based on user interactions.
4. Theme Management: Learned how to implement and manage different themes (light
and dark modes) in a web application.

Project Update:
The project is complete with all intended features implemented successfully. The TO-DO
application allows users to manage their tasks effectively and offers a dark mode for better
user experience under different lighting conditions. The final code is well-structured, and the
application is fully functional.
